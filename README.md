# Company-Layoffs-EDA-in-SQL

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to measure different companies' layoffs during COVID years (2020-2023). We are seeking to find out which companies had the largest layoffs in each year of the pandemic.

### Data Sources

Layoffs Data: The main data source used for this project was the dataset from the "layoffs.csv" file, which contains raw, uncleaned information about different company layoffs including location, stage of company, dates, and numerical information. 

### Tools

- Excel - Loaded Dataset; Easy Initial Viewing
- MySQL Workbench - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In cleaning, we performed the following:
1. Removed all duplicate values by creating a secondary set and partitioning the data.
2. Standardized all data by trimming white space.
3. Turned a date column from a text type to a datetime.
4. Repaired any blank or null values we could, and removed the rest
